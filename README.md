Feels like I don't know whats going on half the time :ppp  
Hi I'm DFox and I use arch btw. That's literally the only thing I got going for me atm lol.  
Learning (actually good)python, rust, js, and how the hell to exit nvim.  
Feel free to tell me how stupid my code is (it's very appreciated but also don't torture yourself).
